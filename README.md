**Description** MooMy is a marketplace app that people can shop for local used goods. The business model is such that for every transaction that occurs on the app, MooMy takes 1%. For example, if a used bike is sold at $100 then MooMy makes $1 on the transaction. The transaction that occurs is similar to how Venmo does it (using APIs to speak to financial institutions).
